Expected solution:
   class Animal
     attr_reader :type, :quantity, :frequency

     def initialize
        @type = "Beans"
        @quantity = "1 cup"
        @frequency = 1
     end

     def food_preference
       "I eat #{quantity} #{type}, #{frequency} times daily"
     end
   end

   def Dog < Animal
     @type = "Meat"
     @frequency = 2
   end

   def Cat < Animal
     @type = "Fish"
     @quantity = "4 oz"
     @frequency = 4
   end

   def Bird < Animal
