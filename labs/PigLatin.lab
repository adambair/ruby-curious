Description:
   Given an English sentance on STDIN, print the sentance in Pig Latin to STDOUT.
      * Pig Latin rules: 1: If the word begins with consonants, move those consonants to the end of the word.
                         2: Append "ay" to the word.
      * Example: 'Do you think dogs are better than cats?' becomes 'oDay ouyay inkthay ogsday areay etterbay anthay atscay?'
      * Bonus: Does 'qu' act as one consonant?  Is 'queen' 'ueenqay' or 'eenquay'?
